<--- ABOUT --->
A Computer Lab reservation app allows you to book seats in three different labs at your desired time and date, up to 7 days in advance. 
You can also edit your reservations and update your profile. The app supports two types of accounts: Student and Lab Technician. 
Students have a limited view, while Lab Technicians can access all reservations, 
cancel them within 10 minutes after the reserved time, and make reservations on behalf of students.
